# 1. How to run this application

## 1.1.	Navigate to the root folder .\adevinta\
## 1.2.	Navigate to the backend folder .\adevinta\api
## 1.3.	Run 'npm install && npm start'
## 1.4.	Navigate to the frontend folder .\adevinta\client
## 1.5.	Run 'npm install && npm start'


# 2. Next steps

If I had more time to work on the project, I would implement the following features:

## 2.1. Frontend

### - Implement tests (unit and integration)
### - Add a form to insert data to the database
### -

## 2.2 Backend

### - Cover 100% of the application with tests
### - Add further methods (post, patch, delete)
### - Use SQL instead NoSQL to deal with DB
